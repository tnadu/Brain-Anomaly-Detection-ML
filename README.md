# Brain Anomaly Detection - ML Models and Approaches

## General Description
Structured around a Kaggle competition, as a part of the Artificial Intelligence
course of the University of Bucharest, these Machine Learning models aim to
classify a data set containing CT scans of the brain as accurately as possible.
The two classes consist of normal and abnormal scans.

## Models and Techniques
Various preprocessing methods were employed, such as random data splitting and image
augmentation. As for the Machine Learning models, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest-Neighbours,
Support Vector Machines and Convolutional Neural Networks were all used.

## Dependencies
Python 3.11 along with several libraries are necessary in order to run the source code:
- pandas
- cv2
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- tensorflow
